          JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
          JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. JavaScript is easy
          to learn.
        </p>

        <h3>Why we should study JavaScript.</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is one of the three languages every web developer must know
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>HTML To define Content</li>
          <li>CSS To specify layout</li>
          <li>JAVASCIPT To program behaviours of the webpage hence Dynamic.</li>

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
            (WWW).
          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>Some programming experience.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-secion">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>To get started, open you browsers console window. Or create a <pre>.HTML</pre> file; Inside the <pre>script</pre> tags code:

        <pre>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </pre>
      </p>
